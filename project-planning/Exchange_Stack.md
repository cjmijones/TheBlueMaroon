| \# | Feature | Purpose / Reg hook | Buy / OSS package | Integration sketch (Blue Maroon) |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **5-1** | **Matching Engine** | Core trade execution; must support price-time priority & locked/crossed protection (§6(b)(5)) | **Open-source**: undefinedor *QuickFIX Match*; **Commercial**: *Nasdaq MiQ* white-label | Deploy as Rust micro-service in its own **k8s** namespace on AWS Nitro / EKS. Expose gRPC API; FastAPI gateway translates REST/FIX into gRPC. Use Neon Postgres only for *reference* data; transactional book state lives in in-memory log (Chronicle Queue) with hourly snapshots to S3-Glacier-Immutable. |
| **5-2** | **Order/Quote Gateways** | Member connectivity; validate 15c3-5 pre-trade checks | OSS **QuickFIX/J** (FIX 4.4/5.0SP2) + custom Rule 611 router | Gateways run Python asyncio wrapper that calls QuickFIX/J via JNI; enforce credit/fat-finger limits from Redis cache (populated by FastAPI admin UI). |
| **5-3** | **Audit-trail (CAT) emitter** | Mandatory reporting to FINRA CAT (17 CFR 242.613) | **Catapult** SDK (FINOS) or commercial *Jordan & Jordan* CAT reporter | Gateways stream normalized order events into **Kafka/Redpanda**. A CAT-emitter consumer builds JSON-L0/L1 files, signs with private key, pushes nightly via SFTP to FINRA. |
| **5-4** | **Real-time Surveillance** | §6(b)(1) enforce fair market + Reg SCI “automated surveillance” | *Eventus Validus* SaaS (buy) **or** OSS combo: **Apache Flink + DeBloat** rule library | Topic “executed-trades” in Kafka feeds Flink jobs; alerts posted to FastAPI `/alerts` endpoint and persisted in Neon. Front-end React dashboard (Recharts) shows heat map, with Auth0 RBAC (“surveillance-analyst” role). |
| **5-5** | **Market Data Plant (MDP)** | SIP / depth-of-book feeds; Reg NMS compliance | **Exegy Low-Latency MDP** (buy) **or** *BookBuilder* OSS | The matching engine publishes via *Chronicle Wire*. An adapter converts to ITCH/PITCH and UDP multicast. Separate “public‐tape” service publishes to a Socket.IO channel the React client can consume. |
| **5-6** | **System Health & Reg SCI monitors** | Reg SCI Rule 1003(a)(5) “real-time monitoring” | **Prometheus + Grafana**; **ChaosMesh** for fault injection | All k8s pods side-car **otel-collector** → Prometheus. Grafana board includes SCI key metrics (latency p99, reject rates). Alertmanager triggers PagerDuty “SCI-event” run-book, which auto-drafts Form SCI update via FastAPI job. |
| **5-7** | **Disaster-Recovery / BCP** | Reg SCI DR test; §6(b)(7) continuity | AWS multi-AZ hot-hot; **Route 53 ARC** + **Aurora Global** for Postgres read replicas | Terraform module creates secondary region stack. Hourly RPO snapshot of Chronicle logs to S3 (bucket w/ Object-Lock WORM). Periodic *chaos-kill* job validates RTO \< 2 h. |
| **5-8** | **Member Portal** | Rule-book required “fair access” docs, onboarding, fee schedules | Leverage existing React/Tailwind app; add **Radix-UI** DataTable | Add route `/members`: call FastAPI endpoints for membership application CRUD, upload of docs (KYC, OFAC screening via **ComplyAdvantage API**). |
| **5-9** | **Listing Application Portal** | Issuer interface; listing standards (§6(b)(1)) | **DocuSign CLM** for e-sign; object storage S3 | Front-end wizard built in React Hook-Form. Backend FastAPI micro-service `listings/` stores metadata in Neon; docs in S3. Integrates with AWS Textract to auto-pull cap tables. |
| **5-10** | **Risk Controls (Rule 15c3-5-style)** | Though Rule 15c3-5 covers broker-dealers, SEC expects exchanges to hard-block obvious errors | Use **Finsemble RiskGuard** library; fallback to home-grown Python `risk.py` | Gateway calls async risk checks before pass-through to matching engine; breaches logged to surveillance channel & rejected with `FIX 3/207=Risk threshold exceeded`. |
| **5-11** | **Fee & Billing Engine** | §6(b)(4) equitable fees; generates Section 31(a) fees | OSS **Kill-Bill** billing platform | Trades from Kafka “settled-trades” topic sent to Kill-Bill via plugin; invoices PDF’d monthly, exposed via `/billing` API. |
| **5-12** | **Clearing Interface** | Broker give-ups, CNS netting | **DTCC Universal Trade Capture (UTC)** interface (buy) | Post-trade engine formats MSG-ML; SFTP to NSCC; receive CNS settle-files into Neon “clearing” schema. |
| **5-13** | **AML / Sanctions** | if exchange handles funds (for listing fees, etc.) | **Stripe Treasury + ComplyAdvantage** | Webhook in FastAPI processes `customer.verification` events; flags escalate to compliance dashboard. |
| **5-14** | **Access & Authentication** | MFA, role-based access for traders vs. surveillance | Keep current **Auth0**; configure Enterprise SAML for broker-dealers; enable WebAuthn for privileged ops | Extend your existing FastAPI `auth` dependency; add “exchange-member”, “issuer”, “sro-staff” roles. |
| **5-15** | **Immutable Logs (WORM)** | Rule 17a-1 requires 5-year retention | **AWS S3 Object Lock (compliance mode)** or **Wasabi WORM** | Daily cron job archives `/var/log/exchange/*.log` + Kafka topic snapshots. Lifecycle → Glacier Deep Archive. |
| **5-16** | **Public Disclosure Site** | § 6(b)(5) make rules, fees public; Reg SCI quarterly summary | Use existing **Next.js static** site; auto-publish via GitHub Actions when rule YAML changes in repo. |  |
